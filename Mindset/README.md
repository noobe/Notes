The Imposter:
The journey of a software engineer is that of constant learning. The ones that sticks on to the grind are the ones that can constantly evolve and re-invent. This is a very difficult process as we tend to judge ourselve too harshly more often. We end up finding out confort zones where we feel secure, or hiding away our learning process so that we dont project ourselves as ignorant in public. The key to staying relavant may infact be just the opposite of the same. Explore possiblities that challange you out of your confort zone and to try and learn publically.

The first part is pretty easy. Its more of a plunge where you keep questioning your decision until you find the small shade of comfort in the pursuit of happiness. But the second one is the more difficult of the two. We all seems to be wired with the thought that we should always project a confident persona. And we feel that knowing all that we need to some how makes us project that easier. So we tend to hide away our struggles and learning and try to projuct its result as if we were always aware of it, and required no extra learniing. The moment I stopped doing that and became more vocal about my questions - I started to learn faster. People around me started helping me learn it faster by contributing their perspectives on the the subject.
