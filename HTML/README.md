# HTML

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.

## Evolution of HTML
In the early days of internet, it was developed by Universities and the military to share docs. When universities started sharing documents across, the realized that unstyled text files are lighter compared to images or other docs as they contain only character info that can be easily encoded and have less sizes compared to bitmap images.

But reasearch papers are formatted, with typography, images etc. Hence there was a need to share such formatted content but share it in fewer bytes. This lead to the development of HTML where plain text can be shared along with markups that specify a way to style the text at the recievers end.

Hence the sender sends plain text with markup while the reciever could repaint or render the content as per the text and its markup. Applications that can do this repainting or rendering are called browsers
