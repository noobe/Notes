# Raodmap to be a fullstack softawre architect

## STAGE 01: Writing clean code.
- Be consistent
- Prefer meaningful variable/function/file/class names over comments
- Proper and consistent indentation and style
- Keep methods, classes and file small
- Re-use code as much as possible
- Keep functions as pure as possible
- Refactor switch cases to classes - WHY
- Don't pass boolean - WHY
- Use correct constructs - EXAMPLE?
- Don't pass null - WHY
- Command query separation - EXAMPLE?
- Organize code by the actor it belongs to
- Keep framework code distant - FROM WHAT?
- Tests should be fast, independent and repeatable
- Refactor often

## STAGE 02: Programing paradigms available and why OOP is best for Architecture
- Programming Paradigms
- Structured Programming
- Functional Programming
- Object Oriented Programming

## STAGE 03: Re-Learn OOP (with Model-driven design)
- Object Oriented Paradigm
- 4 Primary Principles
  1. Inheritance
  2. Polymorphism
  3. Abstraction
  4. Encapsulation
- Paradigm Features
  1. Abstract classes
  2. Concrete classes
  3. Scope/Visiblity - WHAT?
  4. Interfaces
- Model Driven Design
  1. Understand domain models - WHAT?
  2. Undestand anemic models - WHAT?
  3. Layered architecture - WHAT?
  4. Domain language - WHAT?
  5. Class invarients - WHAT?

## STAGE 04: Object Oriented design principles to keep flexible and testable
- Design Patterns
- Composition over Inheritance
- Encapsulate what varies - WHAT?
- Program against abstraction - WHAT?
- Hollywood principle - WHAT?
- SOLID - WHAT?
- DRY - WHAT?
- YAGNI - WHAT?

## STAGE 05: Design Patterns
- Creational
  1. Singleton
  2. Factories
  3. Prototypes
  4. Builder
- Structural
  1. Adpater
  2. Bridge
  3. Decorator
  4. Composite
  5. Proxy
- Behavioural
  1. Template
  2. Mediator
  3. Observer
  4. Strategy
  5. Iterator
- PoSA Pattern

## STAGE 06: Architectural Principles
- Policy Vs Detail
- Coupling Vs Cohesion
- Component Principle
- Boundaries

## STAGE 07: Architecture Styls
- Structural
  1. Component-based
  2. Monolithic
  3. Layered
- Messaging
  1. Event Driven
  2. Publsih-Subscribe
- Distribured
  1. Client-Server
  2. Peer to Peer

## STAGE 08: Architectural Patterns
- Domain Driven Design
- Model-View Controller
- Blackboard Pattern
- Microkernel
- CQRS
- Event Sourcing
